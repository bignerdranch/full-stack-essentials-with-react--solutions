# Solutions for the Full Stack Essentials with React course.
Each chapter in the course has a corresponding branch in this repo.

Checking out a branch will set the codebase to match with the *completion* of the chapter.  

To see the starting point for a given chapter, you’d actually need to check out the previous chapter in the series.

Each branch name will follow this pattern:
`appName/chapterNumber/chapterTitle`
