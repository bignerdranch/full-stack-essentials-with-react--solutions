# Solutions for the Full Stack Essentials with React course.
Each chapter in the course has a corresponding branch in this repo.

Checking out a branch will set the codebase to match with the *beginning* of the corresponding chapter.  

To see the final solutions for a given chapter, you’d actually need to check out the next chapter in the series.

Each branch name will follow this pattern:
`appName-chapterNumber-chapterTitle`

The final solutions for each app will follow this pattern:
`appName-complete`
